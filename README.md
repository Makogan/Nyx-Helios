# ![GitHub Logo](/Documentation/RavenLogo.png)  Nyx-Helios 


Nyx and Helios are two small libraries I developped to abstract OpenGL for a quick start in future projects. 
Each library is meant to complement the other but be able to work independently of the other.

## Nyx

Nyx is a GLFW wrapper and GUI integration library

## Helios

Helios is an OpenGL wrapper designed to quick start 3D rendering applications

(Disclaimer both are under current development, they are not currently doing much)
